    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>


        My name is Aziz, I am a 25-year-old originally from TurkeyðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·. I have a passion for teaching and worked as a
        teacher for one year in both Turkey and Ghana. Unfortunately, due to political unrest, I was forced to relocate
        to the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Netherlands, I have quickly settled in, obtaining my residence permit and finding a home within six
        months. I am currently active in two local associations. In one, I organize events, and in the other, I work as
        a video editor. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar and ukulele. I am also dedicated to learning Dutch
        and integrating into Dutch society.
    </p>
    <p>
        In August, I took a MERN stack web development course and am eager to further develop my skills in this area. I
        am currently working on projects using technologies such as React and Node.js. I am a highly motivated and
        sociable individual who is always looking for ways to improve myself. I am confident that my skills and
        experience would be a valuable asset to your team.
