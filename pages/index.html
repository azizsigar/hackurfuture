    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Aziz, and I'm a web developer. I'm excited to share my latest project with you, which is a website
        that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML is the code that provides the structure of a web page. It tells the browser where to put things like text,
        images, and videos. CSS is the code that controls the style of a web page. It determines things like the font,
        color, and layout of the page. JavaScript is the code that makes a web page interactive. It can be used to add
        things like animations, games, and user input.

    </p>
    <p> I used HTML to create the basic structure of my website. I then used CSS to style the page and make it look
        visually appealing. Finally, I used JavaScript to add some interactivity to the page.

    </p>
    <p> I'm really happy with how my website turned out. It's a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be
        used to create a beautiful and functional web page.</p>
    <p>Creating a "Go To Top" button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple yet effective way to improve the user
        experience (UX) of your website. This button provides users with a quick and easy way to return to the top of
        the page, making navigation easier.</p>
    <h2>Project Functionality:</h2>
    <p>In this code, a button with the class name "to-top" is created. The CSS defines the position, style, and behavior
        of the button. The JavaScript controls when the button will be visible and what it will do when clicked.</p>
    <h3>Functionality:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>-The button appears when the page is scrolled down.</li>
        <li>
            -The button is hidden when the page is scrolled up or is at the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            -When the button is clicked, the page scrolls to the top.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Additional Features:</h4>
    <p>You can modify the CSS and JavaScript code to customize the appearance and functionality of the button.</p>
    <p>
        You can add animation to the button.
        You can use the button to redirect to a different page when clicked.</p>
    <h5>Summary:</h5>
    <p>Creating a "Go To Top" button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can make your website more user-friendly and
        improve navigation. The code above is a simple way to do this.</p>
